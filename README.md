</p>
<p>
The ipconfig command in PowerShell is a helpful tool for checking a computer’s network settings. It shows details like the IP address, subnet mask, default gateway, and DNS servers. Whereas the ipconfig /all command in PowerShell gives a more detailed view of your computer’s network configuration compared to the basic ipconfig command. It shows extra information like the MAC address, DHCP status, lease times, and more about each network adapter. You also have to type your commands correctly with no mistakes otherwise you will get errors as shown above.

The nslookup google.com command is a quick way to find out the IP address behind a website name like Google. It checks with the DNS (Domain Name System) to see where that domain is pointing. This is really useful when you're trying to figure out if a website isn’t loading because of a DNS issue.

The ping google.com command is used to check if your computer can reach Google’s servers and how long it takes for data to travel there and back. It’s a quick and simple way to test your internet connection or see if a website is up. If you’re having network issues, ping helps you figure out if the problem is with your connection or something else.
